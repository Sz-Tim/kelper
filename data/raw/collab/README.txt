# Data from Dan Smale and Pip Moore

---------------------------------

Hi Tim

Before I head to Peru on Friday I wanted to send you some raw data as we discussed in the meeting

I hope its useful and makes some kind of sense!!! I’ve sent raw data files from fieldwork so the formatting might be a little shall-we-say inconsistent so hit me up with any questions. 

‘kelp survey data’ is just Lam hyp density/cover for our main sites over time – should make sense (note first 2 tabs are for Lam hyp but there’s also data from Sacchrina latissima which is not relevant here)

‘Depth transect quadrats/transects’ is similar but at 8 sites we collected density/cover/biomass/morphology along a depth gradient. Note the regions are the same as our main sites but the sites are sometimes different. I can send along lat/longs if needed 

‘Dist exp spring 2016’ is different. At eight sites we did a massive clearance experiment and looked at recovery over multiple years. The treatments are ‘summer 2014’ and ‘spring 2015’ but I would just use ‘summer 2014’ for simplicity (this is the experiment used in Smale et al 2020 Sci Reps). The data are collected nearly 2 years after the clearance plot were established and compared with controls.

Good luck!!!!

Dan
